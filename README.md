# Slot Machine
Simple casino-style slot machine with a car parts theme built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Some jQuery was used for testing, but I never got around to cleaning it up or finishing the project.
I was originally planning to add rewards such as:

**Close Call:**       5 of the same symbol in a row but no match
* *Awards 1 credit*


**Three Stripes:**    all 5 columns same color (each row different & unique color)
* *Awards 1 credit*


**Two Pair:**         2 sets of the same symbols with different color     (e.g. 2 blue turbos + 2 red turbos)
* *Awards 1 credit*


**Three Pair:**       3 sets of the same symbols but different colors     (e.g. 2 blue turbos + 2 red turbos + 2 green turbos)
* *Awards 2 credits*


**Double Dip:**       2 sets of 2 different symbols with the same color   (e.g. 2 red batteries + 2 red turbos)
* *Awards 2 credits*


**Triple Dip:**       3 sets of 2 different symbols with the same color   (e.g. 2 red batteries + 2 red turbos + 2 red discs)
* *Awards 3 credits*
* *Invalidates Double Dip*


**Stack Overflow:**   same symbol & color in all 3 rows of the same reel
* *Awards 3 credits*


**Something:**        5 of the same symbol and same color in a row



**Color Lock:**
  * Occurs when the first reel contains 3 unique colors and 3 unique symbols
  * Provides a 100% chance to receive "Three Stripes" bonus
